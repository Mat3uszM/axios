(* iOS Timeout error - Background app state #6014 *)




Background Fetch:

Utilize background fetch mechanisms provided by React Native to periodically perform tasks, such as updating data, when the app is in the background. Adjust the fetch intervals as needed.
Background Execution Configuration:

Ensure that your app is configured to work correctly in the background by specifying the appropriate background modes and capabilities in your iOS project settings. For example, you can enable background fetch and background processing.
Timeout Adjustment:

Review your Axios configuration and adjust the timeout settings to accommodate potentially slower network responses when the app is in the background. You can increase the timeout duration to allow for longer response times.
Network Optimization:

Optimize your network requests to reduce the amount of data transferred and the frequency of requests. Minimize the payload size and reduce the number of requests when possible.
Background Geolocation:

If your app relies on location-based data, consider using background geolocation plugins like react-native-background-geolocation. These plugins can help you continue tracking location data in the background.
Retry Mechanisms:

Implement retry mechanisms in your network requests. When a request times out, schedule retries when the app is back in the foreground. Libraries like axios-retry can assist in implementing automatic retries.
Push Notifications:

Use push notifications to alert users when new data is available. When the user taps the notification, the app can fetch the latest data. This way, you can avoid making background network requests altogether.
Persistent Storage:

Consider persisting important data locally using a database like SQLite or AsyncStorage. When your app is in the background, it can retrieve data from local storage. This minimizes the need for network requests while the app is not active.
Custom Native Modules:

For fine-grained control over background tasks, consider creating custom native modules to interface with iOS background modes or Android background services. This allows you to define specific behaviors for your app in the background.
Battery Considerations:

Keep in mind that background tasks may consume additional battery power. Design your app to be efficient and consider the impact on battery life when implementing background functionality.
